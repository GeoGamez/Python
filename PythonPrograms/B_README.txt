Welcome to Kevin's Birthday card!
Upon starting the program, the bouncing text will prompt the user to put the candle on the cake.
The candle starts on the bottom left of the screen.
To do this you can use the arrow keys:
^ up < left > right v down
The program will continue only if the candle is placed on the cake properly. In order to do that place the candle on the top of the cake with part of the candle
in the top of the cake and the flame sticking out.
You will know the program advanced if the text stops bouncing and freezes to the top of the screen. 
Due to the random colours, there is a chance that this next part is not visible or very hard to see so I recommend to get the background to a colour that isn't
neon green or red. 
Upon entering this phase of the program holding down or clicking the left mouse button with unleash "fireworks" from the top of the candle
the fireworks are made up of an arc and a circle.
Pressing H will enable a small help page in the command prompt
Pressing S stops the text bounce.
Pressing q makes some snow fall
Pressing r resets the snow

Somethings you might have missed:
The sparkles on the cake are random, everytime you start up the program it should be different!
